# Animal Cage
Basically a standalone mod version of the Animal Net from the Hatchery mod.

Benefits over the Animal Net:
- It's a standalone mod, so if you just want the Animal Net you might consider this instead. 
- It's available for Minecraft 1.12, unlike Hatchery. Hopefully they make the port soon, but this'll do until then.

Might upgrade it one day to be able to put multiple animals into it at once, or even display an entire inventory of mobs. Like a mini Noah's ark, it would be a nice way to keep a backup of some of your animals in case something goes awry.
